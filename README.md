# react-math-game
game for react class

## Steps

1. Create a new empty directory named react-math-game
2. Open a terminal emulator and make react-math-game the working directory
3. type node -v to test whether you already have node installed.
4. If you do have it installed correctly, you'll get a version number back that will be in the format #.#.#. The first digit of this version number should be 10 or higher. If it is, skip to step 6. If it isn't you'll need to upgrade node. To upgrade node, go to https://nodejs.org and click the link to download the current LTS version. Double click the downloaded file and follow the instructions to install it.
5. If you had to upgrade or install Node, close and restart your terminal application and type node -v to confirm that the version is now higher than 10.
6. In your terminal, type npm -v. If the number you get back is higher than 5.2, skip to step 8.
7. If your npm version number is lower than 5.2, type npm install npm -g in your terminal.
8. Type npx create-react-app mathificent to create a starter project named "mathificent". The depedencies will be downloaded and after a while you'll have a new React project.
9. Type cd mathificent followed by npm start. A web browser window will open and you'll see the default create-react-app starter project.

10. Open your mathificent directory in your code editor.
11. Open src/App.js for editing.
12. Take a look at the structure of this file. It imports the React library, and then contains a function with a return statement. This function creates a component. The job of a component is to output a piece of the user interface.
